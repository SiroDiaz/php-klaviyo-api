Klaviyo API wrapper for PHP. It allows to consume the Klaviyo v1 API using a clear and simple
PHP class format for make the usage user-friendly. Stuff like delete a list is as logic as doing:
`$klaviyo->list->delete('asdD2e2')`. Easy, isn't it?

## Installation
Installing php-klaviyo-api is simple. You just need Composer installed and added to the path. For install the
current last version run:

`composer require siro/php-klaviyo-api:"^1.4.0"`

## Usage

### API organization

The php-klaviyo-api is organized as the official Klaviyo API, really.
If you want to access to event API you must do as follow:

```php
// klaviyo Event API
$klaviyo->event->track($event, $customerProperties, $properties);
$klaviyo->event->trackAsync($event, $customerProperties, $properties);

// email template API
$klaviyo->template->getAll();
$klaviyo->template->create('newuser', $htmlString);

// lists API
$klaviyo->list->getLists();
$klaviyo->list->create('premium');
```

A real example would be as i show here:

```php
<?php

use Siro\Klaviyo\KlaviyoAPI;

$klaviyo = new KlaviyoAPI();
$klaviyo->event->trackAsync(
    'register', [
        'email' => 'federico@gmail.com'
    ], []
);

```

As you can see it is really easy. The code is good organized, with the same
documentation that the official one. You just need to read a bit and you will see that it is simple and intuitive.

### Klaviyo Event API

This API is used to track events to Klaviyo. This is the main feature
and you maybe would use it. By that reason i implemented this API wrapper
in this way.
